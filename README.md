# Breath BeLow

Welcome to cave diving, where the rocks are sharp, and your decisions are sharper. This is a cave dive game controlled by your breath. And yes, you can literally play with a real snorkel mask. Put a microphone in the snorkel, breathe like you’re actually underwater, and your real breathing becomes your in-game oxygen management. Panic breathing burns air. Calm breathing keeps you alive. Also: spikes exist. They’re very excited to meet you.

Lose conditions: out of air and spikes
Controls: Mic breathing (snorkel-mask mode if you have it) + keyboard to navigate

The game is built as a part of the "Global Game Jam 2026": https://globalgamejam.org/games/2026/breath-below-8
