# Breath BeLow

Welcome to cave diving, where the rocks are sharp, and your decisions are sharper. This is a cave dive game controlled by your breath. And yes, you can literally play with a real snorkel mask. Put a microphone in the snorkel, breathe like you’re actually underwater, and your real breathing becomes your in-game oxygen management. Panic breathing burns air. Calm breathing keeps you alive. Also: spikes exist. They’re very excited to meet you.

Lose conditions: out of air and spikes
Win conditions: reach the end of the cave

Controls (Diver Suit Manual)
- W/A/S/D: Swim up / left / down / right through the water.
- Q / E: Roll counter-clockwise / clockwise to reorient your suit.
- Mic breathing (snorkel-mask mode if you have it) to control the oxygen level.

How to build the mask:
- Take a snorkel mask
- Put a microphone or wireless earbuds in the snorkel
- Put the mask on your face
- Breathe like you're actually underwater
- The game will detect your breathing and adjust the oxygen level accordingly

The game is built as a part of the "Global Game Jam 2026": https://globalgamejam.org/games/2026/breath-below-8
